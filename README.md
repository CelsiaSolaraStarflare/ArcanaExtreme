### 🔍 Key Terms

- **IDXDB**: The "Database" — a temporary, session-based data cache used during chatbot interactions.

### 🧭 Navigation and Interface

```txt
🌟 Chatbot Page:
 - "Default" Mode → Uses ArcanaLTE's general AI bot
 - "IDX" Mode → Searches your own database content (from uploaded files)
 - "Reasoning" Mode → Uses the Qwen-QWQ model for in-depth, logical responses
 - "Long Text" Mode → Combines indexing and the Qwen-Long Text model for longer, more contextual answers

📂 Files Page:
 - Drag and drop your files to upload them
 - Wait for pre-indexing to finish
 - Files will appear in the "Finder" section
 - Organize your data and click "Index to Database" to finalize it
 - Once indexing is complete, switch to "IDX" mode in Chatbot to begin querying your data!
```
